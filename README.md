## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/olyaiy/ai-canvas
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```env
# Create a .env.local file with:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to start building flows.

## Usage

### Creating a New Flow

1. Use the buttons in the bottom-right corner to add nodes:
   - "New Prompt" - Add input prompts
   - "New GPT Agent" - Add OpenAI GPT nodes
   - "New Claude Agent" - Add Anthropic Claude nodes

2. Connect nodes by dragging from one node's handle to another

3. Configure nodes by clicking on them and adjusting their parameters

4. Save your flow using the "Save Project" button

### Node Types

- **Prompt Input Node**: Entry point for user prompts
- **GPT Node**: OpenAI's GPT model integration
- **Claude Node**: Anthropic's Claude model integration
